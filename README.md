### An Objective Analysis of the Subjective Quality of French Fries
#### Status: Done, [Posted Online](http://adambrownell.com/blog//data_blog/fries.html)

My analysis of french fry quality. The search for the greastest french fry is ripe with fun data, and I ended up writing a paper about it (that ArXiv rejected...). I still very much make the case that it is important and valid research. Time will vindicate me.

I got to make fun charts like this one:

# Jobless Project

### What "Unemployment" Really is, and how to Keep it Down at All Costs
#### Status: Done

I wanted to play around with government data, and this was an interesting angle to take. I got taken down a few rabbit holes, and ended up analyzing ways to take over the world and teach animals to read. It was a good time.

# GoT 8.3
### Why Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 3 was objectively Bad 
#### Done

I wanted to figure out how to value a characters death in a show based on objective metrics, and Game of Thrones was a good way to do it. Also the episode was terrible in itself and worthly of bashing
